# Graph2GO
## Notice
As of August 2025, due to resource limitations, the Shiny application of Graph2GO is no longer maintained. The code and data provided here are available for academic use under the stated license.

## Description
This is a graph-based representation learning method for predicting protein functions. We use both network information and node attributes to improve the performance. Protein-protein interaction (PPIs) networks and sequence similarity networks are used to construct graphs, which are used to propagate node attribtues, according to the definition of graph convolutional networks.

We use amino acid sequence (CT encoding), subcellular location (bag-of-words encoding) and protein domains (bag-of-words encoding) as the node attributes (initial feature representation).

The auto-encoder part of our model is improved based on the implementation by T. N. Kifp. You can find the source code [here](https://github.com/tkipf/gae).
